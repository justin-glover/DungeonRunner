You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.
    Flood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.
    If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20 foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.
    The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.
    Part Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.
    Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.
    Whirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.
    When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.
    The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</text><sclass>Cleric</sclass><sclass>Druid</sclass><sclass>Wizard</sclass></spell><spell><source>1</source><name>Dispel Evil and Good</name><level>5</level><school>1</school><time>1 action</time><range>Self</range><components>V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)</components><duration>Concentration, up to 1 minute</duration><text>Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane.

    You can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.
    Break Enchantment. As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.
    Dismissal. As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn’t there already). If they aren’t on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.</text><sclass>Cleric</sclass><sclass>Paladin</sclass></spell><spell><source>1</source><name>Stone Shape</name><level>4</level><school>8</school><time>1 action</time><range>Touch</range><components>V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)</components><duration>Instantaneous</duration><text>You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose.

The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.
    A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.
    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th level slot, to 30 days with a 7th  level slot, to 180 days with an 8th level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th level spell slot.</text><sclass>Bard</sclass><sclass>Cleric</sclass><sclass>Druid</sclass><sclass>Wizard</sclass></spell><spell><source>1</source><name>Raise Dead</name><level>5</level><school>7</school><time>1 hour</time><range>Touch</range><components>V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)</components><duration>Instantaneous</duration><text>You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.
    This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead creature to life.
    This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.
    Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.</text><sclass>Bard</sclass><sclass>Cleric</sclass><sclass>Paladin</sclass></spell><spell><source>1</source><name>Create or Destroy Water</name><level>1</level><school>8</school><time>1 action</time><range>30 feet</range><components>V, S, M (a drop of water if creating water or a few grains of sand if destroying it)</components><duration>Instantaneous</duration><text>You either create or destroy water.

    On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
    The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24 hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.

    On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.
    On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a hallow spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.
    First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.
    Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.
    Courage. Affected creatures can’t be frightened while in the area.
    Darkness. Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can’t illuminate the area.
    Daylight. Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell can’t extinguish the light.
    Energy Protection. Affected creatures in the area have resistance to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
    Energy Vulnerability. Affected creatures in the area have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
    Everlasting Rest. Dead bodies interred in the area can’t be turned into undead.
    Extradimensional Interference. Affected creatures can’t move or travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.
    Fear. Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.
    Silence. No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.
    Tongues. Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they don’t share a common language.</text><sclass>Cleric</sclass></spell><spell><source>1</source><name>Locate Object</name><level>2</level><school>3</school><time>1 action</time><range>Self</range><components>V, S, M (a forked twig)</components><duration>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</duration><text>Describe or name an object that is familiar to you.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
    The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.
    You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
    You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
    When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.
    Explosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20 foot radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.
    Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.</text><sclass>Bard</sclass><sclass>Cleric</sclass><sclass>Wizard</sclass></spell><spell><source>1</source><name>Augury</name><level>2</level><school>3</school><ritual>1</ritual><time>1 minute</time><range>Self</range><components>V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)</components><duration>Instantaneous</duration><text>By casting gem inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.

    If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.</text><prepared>1</prepared><sclass>Cleric</sclass><sclass>Paladin</sclass></spell><spell><source>1</source><name>Find Traps</name><level>2</level><school>3</school><time>1 action</time><range>120 feet</range><components>V, S</components><duration>Instantaneous</duration><text>You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
    This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don’t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.</text><sclass>Cleric</sclass><sclass>Druid</sclass><sclass>Ranger</sclass></spell><spell><source>1</source><name>Greater Restoration</name><level>5</level><school>1</school><time>1 action</time><range>Touch</range><components>V, S, M (diamond dust worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)</components><duration>Instantaneous</duration><text>You imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a debilitating effect.

The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn’t of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.
    The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: “Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the lips.”</text><sclass>Bard</sclass><sclass>Cleric</sclass><sclass>Wizard</sclass></spell><spell><source>1</source><name>Mending</name><school>8</school><time>1 minute</time><range>Touch</range><components>V, S, M (two lodestones)</components><duration>Instantaneous</duration><text>This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin.
